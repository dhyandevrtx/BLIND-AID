## 🦯 Drishya Sahayak (Blind Aid)

**Drishya Sahayak** is an AI-powered smart vision assistant designed to support visually impaired individuals, helping them navigate their surroundings and public spaces with confidence and safety. Built around the powerful **Raspberry Pi 5**, the system is compactly carried in a **side bag** and connected to a pair of **AI-enabled smart glasses** equipped with a camera.

### 🔍 Key Features

* **🔎 AI Object Detection**: Real-time recognition of people, vehicles, obstacles, and landmarks using computer vision.
* **🎧 Audio Feedback**: Voice alerts through speaker or headphone, guiding the user with natural instructions (e.g., "Obstacle ahead", "Stairs to your left").
* **📍 GPS Navigation**: Turn-by-turn guidance using **Google Maps API**, ideal for outdoor navigation with spoken directions to destinations.
* **🎙️ Voice Assistant**: Wake-word-activated assistant that can respond to commands like “What’s ahead?”, “Battery status?”, “Guide to market”.
* **📳 Vibration Feedback**: Direction-based or distance-based vibrations to alert the user in noisy environments.
* **🔋 Rechargeable Battery**: Efficient and portable power system enabling long-duration use.

### 🧠 System Overview

The brain of the system is a **Raspberry Pi 5**, selected for its excellent processing capabilities. The Pi runs an AI model for real-time object detection and handles GPS-based navigation. It communicates with the user via voice alerts and haptic feedback. A small camera is mounted on a wearable glasses frame, giving a direct line of sight similar to a human perspective.

The Raspberry Pi is housed in a **compact, lightweight side bag**, making the entire setup both discreet and comfortable to wear for extended periods.
